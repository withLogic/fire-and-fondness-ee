Given that third-degree burns are not condusive to successful courtship, one would be well-advised to avoid this fate.

Reaching one's beau unflambed is a sufficiently amative gesture that one may proceed to the next romantically life-threatening venue; however, the truly chivalrous may take it upon themselves to recover a bunch of roses from the death-trap before proceeding. Upon finishing the last maze, judgement shall be passed on the merit of your bond.
