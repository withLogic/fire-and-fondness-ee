story = "You have toiled through each hazardous labyrinth, and escaped with your life; and more importantly, your beloved.

Sadly, we cannot show you a picture of the two of you staring wistfully into each others' eyes, as our budget does not allow for it. Please take us at our word when we say that the love that has bloomed today will last forever, and is in no way the result of adrenaline from surviving some ill-advised courtship ritual.

But who can say what our lovestruck heroes will do? What new quests will they undertake; over what once-insurmountable odds will they triumph, strengthened as they are, hands locked in sweaty, faintly smoke-smelling comradeship?

None can say. But at the very least, we can be sure that the game you have just played stands you in better stead for finding longlasting happiness than anything Richard La Ruina has ever done."
